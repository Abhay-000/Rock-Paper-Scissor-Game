The Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Python is a classic example of a simple yet engaging console-based game.
In this game, the player selects either rock, paper, or scissors, while the computer randomly chooses one of these options as well. 
The rules are straightforward: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The outcome of each round is determined by comparing the choices of the player and the computer.
The game continues until the player decides to quit. This project is an excellent exercise for beginners in Python to practice user input, conditional statements, random number generation, and basic control flow. 
It can be further expanded with features like keeping score, adding more options, or creating a graphical interface for enhanced user experience.
